### Problem Statement:

Your task is to create a TO-DO list web application that is accessible to all classes of physically disabled people, including:

- Blind people
- People with Low Vision
- People with Color Blindness
- People with Limited Dexterity
- People with Paralysis
- Single Hand Usage

**Requirements**:

- The web app should provide accessibility features such as screen reader support, high contrast mode, keyboard navigation, and voice commands where applicable.
- Implement inclusive UI/UX that adjusts based on user preferences or limitations.
- You are free to choose the stack but must provide instructions to run the app locally.
- If you are a **Full Stack Developer**, you should also implement backend data storage for the TO-DO items, ensuring the user data is stored in a database (e.g., MongoDB, SQL).

**Deliverables**:

- A fully functional accessible web application.
- Include instructions in your README file on how to run the app.
- Use any framework/library of your choice (React, Angular, Vue for frontend; Node.js, Django, or Flask for backend).

**Push the source code along with a demo video of your solution into the forked github repo. Share the repo link in the google form: https://forms.gle/2HbLP8GNiYArZFsj8
